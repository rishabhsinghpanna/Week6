    "A database is a structured collection of data that is organized and stored in a computer system. It is designed to efficiently store, retrieve, and manage large amounts of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL (Structured Query Language) and NoSQL (Not Only SQL) are two different types of database management systems (DBMS) that differ in their data models, storage mechanisms, and querying languages. Here's a brief differentiation between the two:\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL Databases:\n",
    "- SQL databases are based on the relational model, where data is organized into tables with predefined schemas. Each table consists of rows and columns, and relationships between tables are established using primary and foreign keys.\n",
    "- SQL databases use structured query language (SQL) to manage and manipulate data. SQL provides a standardized way to define, query, and manipulate data in a relational database.\n",
    "- SQL databases provide strong data consistency, transaction support, and ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) properties. They are typically used in applications where data integrity and complex querying capabilities are crucial, such as financial systems or applications with complex relationships between data entities.\n",
    "\n",
    "NoSQL Databases:\n",
    "- NoSQL databases encompass a wide range of database technologies that do not follow the traditional relational model. They provide flexible data models for unstructured, semi-structured, and structured data.\n",
    "- NoSQL databases are designed to handle large volumes of rapidly changing, heterogeneous data. They excel in horizontal scalability and distributed computing environments.\n",
    "- NoSQL databases use various data models, such as key-value, document, columnar, and graph, to store and organize data based on the specific requirements of the application.\n",
    "- NoSQL databases typically have relaxed consistency models, favoring availability and scalability over strong consistency. They often provide eventual consistency, where data may temporarily be inconsistent across distributed nodes but eventually becomes consistent.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, SQL databases follow a structured, relational model and use SQL for querying, while NoSQL databases provide flexible data models and offer various ways to store and query data, depending on the specific use case. SQL databases are suited for complex, structured data with strong consistency requirements, while NoSQL databases are suitable for handling large-scale, rapidly changing data with high scalability needs."

    "DDL stands for Data Definition Language, and it is a subset of SQL (Structured Query Language) used to define and manage the structure of a database. DDL statements are used to create, modify, and delete database objects such as tables, views, indexes, and constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the explanations of the commonly used DDL statements:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. CREATE: The CREATE statement is used to create a new database object, such as a table, view, index, or constraint. For example, to create a table named \"Employees\" with columns like \"ID,\" \"Name,\" and \"Salary,\" you would use the following SQL statement:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```sql\n",
    "   CREATE TABLE Employees (\n",
    "       ID INT,\n",
    "       Name VARCHAR(50),\n",
    "       Salary DECIMAL(10, 2)\n",
    "   );\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. DROP: The DROP statement is used to remove an existing database object, such as a table, view, index, or constraint. For example, to delete the \"Employees\" table created earlier, you would use the following SQL statement:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```sql\n",
    "   DROP TABLE Employees;\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. ALTER: The ALTER statement is used to modify the structure of an existing database object. It allows you to add, modify, or delete columns in a table, change data types, or redefine constraints. For example, to add a new column called \"Department\" to the \"Employees\" table, you would use the following SQL statement:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```sql\n",
    "   ALTER TABLE Employees\n",
    "   ADD Department VARCHAR(50);\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. TRUNCATE: The TRUNCATE statement is used to delete all the data from a table while keeping its structure intact. It is a faster alternative to the DELETE statement when you want to remove all the records from a table. For example, to remove all the data from the \"Employees\" table, you would use the following SQL statement:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```sql\n",
    "   TRUNCATE TABLE Employees;\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "These are just a few examples of how CREATE, DROP, ALTER, and TRUNCATE statements can be used in DDL. These statements provide powerful capabilities for defining and managing the structure of a database to meet the requirements of an application or system."

    "\n",
    "2. UPDATE:\n",

    "\n",
    "Suppose we want to update the LastName of an employee with EmployeeID 1 to 'Smith' in the \"Employees\" table.\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This statement will update the LastName column to 'Smith' for the row where EmployeeID is equal to 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. DELETE:\n",
    "The DELETE statement is used to remove one or more rows from a table. It allows you to specify conditions to determine which rows should be deleted. Here's an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we want to delete an employee with EmployeeID 2 from the \"Employees\" table.\n",

    "In relational databases, both primary keys and foreign keys are used to establish relationships between tables and ensure data integrity. Here's an explanation of each:\n",
    "\n",
    "Primary Key:\n",
    "A primary key is a column or a set of columns in a table that uniquely identifies each row or record in that table. It serves as a unique identifier for the records and ensures that there are no duplicate values within the column(s) designated as the primary key. The primary key constraint is used to enforce this uniqueness.\n",
    "\n",
    "Properties of a primary key:\n",
    "1. Uniqueness: Each value in the primary key column(s) must be unique within the table.\n",
    "2. Non-nullability: A primary key column cannot contain null values. Each row must have a valid primary key value.\n",
    "3. Immutable: The value of a primary key should not change over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Typically, a primary key is created using a single column, such as an auto-incrementing ID column, or a combination of multiple columns that, together, uniquely identify a row. For example, in a \"Customers\" table, a primary key could be a column named \"CustomerID\" that assigns a unique identifier to each customer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Foreign Key:\n",
    "A foreign key is a column or a set of columns in a table that refers to the primary key of another table. It establishes a link between two tables, defining a parent-child relationship. The foreign key in one table references the primary key in another table, creating a connection between the related rows in the two tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Properties of a foreign key:\n",
    "1. Referential integrity: A foreign key ensures that the values in the referencing column(s) (child table) correspond to the values in the referenced column(s) (parent table).\n",
    "2. Relationship establishment: It defines the relationship between tables, indicating that the values in the foreign key column(s) in the child table are associated with the primary key column(s) in the parent table.\n",
    "3. Optional or mandatory: A foreign key column can allow null values, indicating an optional relationship, or it can be non-nullable, indicating a mandatory relationship.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, consider two tables: \"Orders\" and \"Customers.\" The \"Orders\" table might have a foreign key column called \"CustomerID,\" which references the \"CustomerID\" primary key column in the \"Customers\" table. This foreign key establishes a relationship between orders and customers, allowing you to link specific orders to their respective customers.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, a primary key uniquely identifies rows within a table, while a foreign key establishes relationships between tables by referencing the primary key of another table. Together, these keys help maintain data integrity and enable the efficient management of relational databases."
